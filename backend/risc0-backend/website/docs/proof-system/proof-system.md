# Proof System Overview

![A diagram of a receipt as the output of a zkVM program](assets/receipt.png)
When the RISC Zero [zkVM] executes, it produces a [Receipt] that serves as a
proof of validity of a given [Session].

To confirm that a [Receipt] was honestly generated, use [Receipt::verify()].

The [Receipt] includes a [journal], which contains the public outputs of the
[Session]. The contents of the [journal] are specified by calling
[env::commit()] and [env::commit_slice()] in the [guest] code.

In addition to the journal, a receipt makes a number of claims about the program
execution. These claims are summarized in the [ReceiptClaim].

### Types of Receipts

A [Receipt] can take four main forms.

1. A **[composite receipt]** is a vector of [ZK-STARK]s, one for each [segment].
   Segments & segment proofs are constructed using the [RISC-V Circuit].
2. A **[succinct receipt]** is a single [ZK-STARK] proving an entire [Session].
   A succinct receipt is formed by aggregating the proofs from a composite
   receipt. This is accomplished using the [Recursion Circuit]. Users can also
   aggregate multiple succinct receipts into a single succinct receipt using
   [proof composition].
3. A **[Groth16 receipt]** is a single [Groth16] proof for an entire [Session].
   A Groth16Receipt is formed by verifying a succinct receipt using RISC Zero's
   [Groth16 circuit].
4. A **[fake receipt]** doesn't contain any proof at all. This feature is
   offered to enable rapid prototyping. See [dev-mode] for more information.

The diagram above shows RISC Zero's full proving stack, including the [RISC-V
Circuit], the [Recursion Circuit], and the [Groth16 Circuit]. In this diagram,
the [composite receipt] is the collection of 6 stacked receipts, the [succinct
receipt] is the single receipt after the last use of FRI, and the [Groth16
Receipt] is the tiny receipt that comes from the Groth16 Circuit. For a video
explanation of this architecture and the associated terminology, check out our
[talk from zkSummit 10][zksummit-10].

The details of the RISC Zero ZK-STARK protocol are described in our [ZKP
Whitepaper] and in this [Sequence Diagram]. Documentation for our Groth16
circuit is available in the [zkVM] docs.

### Open-Source Proving

All three of these circuits are open-source and permissionless; anyone may
generate proofs on their own hardware using the implementations available at our
[GitHub]. Users may also choose to delegate the work of proof generation to
[Bonsai].
